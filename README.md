# BattleCON Simulator

An online simulator of the board game BattleCON. BattleCON is a board game simulator of the classic arcade fighting games, but replacing the quick muscle twitching action with more calculated card selection instead.

This simulator exists mostly to try out characters that are yet to be released on the official one by Level99 Games and possibly custom characters.
